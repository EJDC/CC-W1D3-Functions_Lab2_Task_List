# Functions Lab

**Lab Duration: 60 minutes**

### Learning Objectives
- Learn how to break down code into smaller chunks
- Learn how to use functions to encapsulate code
- Refactor the task list program to use functions

### Brief

Given the following list of dictionaries, use functions throughout to create a program to manage a task list.

```python
tasks = [
    { "description": "Wash Dishes", "completed": False, "time_taken": 10 },
    { "description": "Clean Windows", "completed": False, "time_taken": 15 },
    { "description": "Make Dinner", "completed": True, "time_taken": 30 },
    { "description": "Feed Cat", "completed": False, "time_taken": 5 },
    { "description": "Walk Dog", "completed": True, "time_taken": 60 },
]
```

### MVP

As a user, to manage my task list I would like a program that allows me to:

1. Print a list of uncompleted tasks

2. Print a list of completed tasks

3. Print a list of all task descriptions

4. Print a list of tasks where time_taken is at least a given time

5. Print any task with a given description


### Extension

6. Given a description update that task to mark it as complete.

7. Add a task to the list
